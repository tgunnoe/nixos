# Introduction
Nixflk is a template which grants a simple way to use, deploy and manage
[NixOS][nixos] systems for personal and productive use. It does this by
providing a sane repository structure, integrating several popular projects
like [home-manager][home-manager], setting clear guidelines, offering useful
conveniences, and eliminating boilerplate so you can focus on deploying your
systems.

## Getting Started
Check out the [guide](https://flk.nrdxp.dev/doc/start) to get up and running.

## Motivation
NixOS provides an amazing abstraction to manage our computers, but that new
power can sometimes bring feelings of overwhelm and confusion. Having a turing
complete programming language can add an unlimited potential for complexity if
we do it wrong. Instead, we should have a community consensus on how to manage
a NixOS system â€” consider this a first attempt.

___The future is declarative! ðŸŽ‰___

## Community Profiles
There are two branches from which to choose: [core][core] and
[community][community]. The community branch builds on core and includes
several ready-made profiles for discretionary use.

Every package and NixOS profile declared in community is uploaded to
[cachix](./cachix), so everything provided is available without building
anything. This is especially useful for the packages that are
[overridden](./overrides) from master, as without the cache, rebuilds are
quite frequent.

> #### âš  Advisory âš 
> Nixflk leverages the [flakes][flakes] feature available via an _experimental_
> branch of [nix][nix]. Until nix 3.0 is released, this project should be
> considered unstable.
